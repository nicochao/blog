                <p>You’ll find this post in your <code>_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code>jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>To add new posts, simply add a file in the <code>_posts</code> directory that follows the convention <code>YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext</code> and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<pre><code>def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
</code></pre>
